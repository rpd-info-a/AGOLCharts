                        <h2>Violent Crime Comparison</h2>
                        This chart shows most cities in our sample clustering between 900 and 1,300 violent crimes per
                        100,000 persons per year. There are several outliers, with Pontiac, Saginaw and St. Louis
                        having much higher average violent crime rates. Rochester’s average rate for this time period
                        is 996 or 6th lowest out of the 21 total cities. Rochester’s rate has remained fairly stable
                        across the time period, never peaking above 1,260 and remaining consistently below the yearly
                        combined cities’ average. Buffalo, the most similar comparison city, had an average rate of
                        1,372 across this time period. Rochester’s 2017 rate was 897, eighth lowest out of the
                        twenty-one cities. In 2017, Rochester was sixth for rape, fifteenth for robbery, and sixth for
                        aggravated assault (which, along with murder/manslaughter, are the component crimes of violent
                        crime).

                        <h2>Property Crime Comparison</h2>
                        This chart shows that the overall property crime rate in all cities is decreasing. Every single
                        city had lower property crime rates in 2017 than 1985. In many cases, rates are half those in
                        the 1980s. Rochester’s declines have mirrored the broader national declines, falling from over
                        10,000 per year to less than 4,000 in 2017. Over the entire time period, Rochester’s property
                        crime rate is the 6th highest out of the 21 cities; however property crime has been declining
                        faster in Rochester than in comparable cities. Limiting the look to the most recent ten-year
                        period (2007–2016), Rochester ranks 9th lowest out of 21. Rochester’s 2017 rate was 3,803,
                        continuing the trend of decreasing property crime rates, positioning Rochester as the ninth
                        lowest out of the twenty-one cities.

                        <h2>Homicide Comparison</h2>
                        St Louis and Richmond are the clear outliers in this group of cities. 2003 appears to be an
                        abnormally low year for St. Louis, and a small spike for Rochester, resulting in the only year
                        that Rochester had a higher rate than St. Louis. Starting in 2005, Richmond’s rate plummets,
                        and rejoins the cluster of cities that have rates between 10 and 20 homicides per 100,000
                        persons per year. In contrast to Richmond, Akron and Wilmington appear to be trending upwards.
                        The rate of Buffalo, the most similar comparison city, stays close to the rate of Rochester
                        throughout the time period. Rochester’s average homicide rate across the time period was 19.0,
                        or 7th highest out of the 21 cities. Buffalo’s average is 17.2, and St Louis’s is 44.2.
                        Schenectady, Lansing, and Grand Rapids all had averages under 9. Rochester’s 2017 rate was
                        12.9, which was the lowest since 1999 and third lowest since 1985. Rochester ranked was 7th
                        lowest in 2017 out of the 21 cities.

                        This chart shows the majority of cities in the past three years have a rate between 200 and 400
                        robberies per year. Rochester has been in the middle of that range since 2010, with the
                        exception of a spike in the 2013 rate to 436. Cleveland, St. Louis, Wilmington, and Milwaukee
                        have been the cities with the highest rates the past three years, well above 500. Lansing had
                        the lowest rate of these cities every year between 2000 and 2014 with rates in the low 200’s
                        until 2015 when several cities experienced severe drops in reported robbery, with Schenectady
                        the lowest at 155. Rochester also experienced a drop in 2015, leading to Rochester’s lowest
                        robbery rate in this time period, 305. Rochester experienced a slight rise in 2017 in
                        robberies, but the overall rate remains consistent with 2016 levels at 339. This rate is the
                        seventh highest out of the twenty-one cities.

                        cities. Across the time period, Rochester has the 3rd lowest aggravated assault rate, at 436
                        per year. Two small cities in Michigan, Saginaw (1,761) and Pontiac (1,464) have the highest
                        rate for this time period, followed by St Louis at 1,432. Rochester’s 2017 numbers rank it at
                        sixth lowest out of twenty-one, at 463. Richmond has the lowest rate for 2017 with 293, while

                        <h2>Burglary Comparison</h2>
                        This chart shows collective burglary rates declining from the 1980s and 1990s to the current
                        time, with a slight uptick in 2010 and 2011. Rochester’s rate mirrors this trend. While
                        Rochester’s burglary rate in the 1980s and early 1990s was in the upper half of these cities
                        (7th highest in 1985 and 1986, 4th in 1989, 2nd in 1992, 3rd in 1993), Rochester’s rate
                        declined faster than most comparison cities throughout the 1990s. In 2001 and 2002, Rochester
                        ranked 3rd and 2nd lowest respectively. A slight rise in the late 2000s resulted in a recent
                        peak in 2010, but Rochester has observed consecutive declines every year since then.
                        Rochester’s 2017 burglary numbers were the lowest in 30 years, continuing the downward trend
                        and resulting in the 4th lowest rate of the 21 cities.

                        <h2>Larceny Comparison</h2>
                        Larceny, like burglary, spiked in the early 1990s and has declined steadily since (without
                        burglary’s spike in the late 2000s). Unlike burglary, Rochester has consistently had higher
                        than average larceny rates, compared with the other twenty cities. Rochester has been
                        experiencing declines in larceny rates similar to the other cities, but starting from a higher
                        baseline. Those declines resulted in Rochester ending 2016 in the middle of this group of
                        cities, with the eleventh highest rate out of the twenty-one cities, at a rate of 2,755
                        larcenies per year. Rochester’s 2017 rate increased slightly, to 2,864, resulting in Rochester
                        dropping to fourteenth lowest of the cities. Despite the increase, 2017 resulted in the second
                        lowest rate and second lowest raw number of larcenies in Rochester’s previous 30 years.
