                    <h2>Violent Crime Comparison</h2>
                    This chart shows most cities in our sample clustering between 900 and 1200 violent crimes per 100,000 persons per year. There
                    are several outliers, with Pontiac, Saginaw and St Louis having much higher average violent crime rates.
                    Rochester’s average for this time period is 999/100,000/year, or 16th out of the 21 total cities. Rochester’s
                    rate has remained fairly stable across the time period, never peaking above 1260 and remaining consistently
                    below the yearly average across these cities. Buffalo, the “most similar” comparison city, had an average
                    rate of 1383 across this time period. Rochester’s 2016 rate was 879 per 100,000, seventh out of the twelve
                    cities for which data is available. Rochester was either seventh or eight out of twelve for rape, robbery,
                    and aggravated assault (which, along with murder/manslaughter, are the component crimes of violent crime).

                    <h2>Property Crime Comparison</h2>
                    This chart shows that the overall property crime rate in all cities is decreasing. Every single city had lower property crime
                    rates in 2015 than 1985. In many cases, rates are half those in the 1980s. Rochester’s declines have
                    mirrored the broader national declines, falling from over 10,000/100,000/year to less than 4000 in 2015.
                    Over the entire time period for which we have data, Rochester’s property crime rate is 6th out of 21;
                    however property crime has been declining faster in Rochester than in comparable cities. Limiting the
                    look to 2005 – 2015, Rochester ranks 11th out of 21, very close to Buffalo (5263 & 5328 respectively).
                    Rochester’s 2016 rate was 3723 per 100,000, continuing the trend of decreasing property crime rates.
                    For cities with 2016 data available, only Syracuse and Schenectady had lower property crime (burglary,
                    motor vehicle theft, larceny) rates.

                    <h2>Homicide Comparison</h2>
                    St Louis and Richmond are the clear outliers in this group of cities. 2003 appears to be an abnormally low year for St Louis,
                    and a small spike for Rochester, resulting in the only year that Rochester had a higher rate than St
                    Louis. Starting in 2005, Richmond’s rate plummets, and rejoins the cluster of cities that have rates
                    between 10 and 20 homicides per 100,000 persons per year. In contrast to Richmond, Wilmington and Syracuse
                    appear to be trending upwards. The rate of Buffalo, the “most similar” comparison city, stays close to
                    the rate of Rochester throughout the time period. The average homicide rate across the time period was
                    19.3/100,000 per year, or 7th out of the 21 cities. Buffalo’s average is 17.2, and St Louis’s is 43.5.
                    Schenectady, Lansing, and Grand Rapids all had averages under 9. Rochester’s 2016 rate was 21 per 100,000,
                    sixth out of the thirteen cities for which data is available.

                    <h2>Robbery Comparison</h2>
                    This chart shows the majority of cities in the past three years with between 200 and 400 robberies per hundred thousand persons
                    per year. Rochester has been in the middle of that range since 2010, with the exception of a spike in
                    2013 of 436/100,000. Rochester’s 2016 numbers keep it within that range, with a rate of 319. Cleveland,
                    Milwaukee, and Wilmington have been the top three cities for the past three years with rates well above
                    500. Lansing had the lowest rate of these cities every year between 2000 and 2014 with rates in the low
                    200s, however their streak was broken in 2015 when several cities experienced severe drops in reported
                    robbery, with Schenectady the lowest at 155.

                    Rochester’s Aggravated Assault rate stays consistently below the average rate of these 21 cities. Across the time period,
                    Rochester has the 18th highest assault rate, with 434/100,000/year. Two small cities in Michigan, Saginaw
                    (1795) and Pontiac (1513) have the highest rate for this time period, followed by St Louis at 1445. Rochester’s
                    2016 numbers keep put it at 8th out of the twelve cities for which we have data, at 463. Cincinnati has
                    the lowest rate for 2016 with 257, while St Louis has the highest with 1152.

                    <h2>Burglary Comparison</h2>
                    The burglary rate chart shows rates declining from the 1980s and 1990s to the current time, with a slight rise in 2010 &
                    2011. Rochester’s rate mirrors these trends. While Rochester’s burglary rate in the 1980s and early 1990s
                    was in the upper half of these cities (7th in 1985 and 1986, 4th in 1989, 2nd in 1992, 3rd in 1993),
                    Rochester’s rate then declined faster than most comparison cities throughout the 1990s. In 2001 and 2002,
                    Rochester ranked 18th out of the 21 cities. A slight rise in the late 2000s resulted in a peak in 2010
                    and 2011, with consecutive declines every year since then. Rochester’s 2016 burglary numbers were the
                    lowest in 30 years, continuing the decrease.

                    <h2>Larceny Comparison</h2>
                    Larceny, like burglary, spiked in the early 1990s and has declined steadily since (without burglary’s spike in the late 2000s).
                    Unlike burglary, Rochester has consistently had higher than average larceny rates, compared with the
                    other twenty cities. Rochester has been experiencing declines in larceny rates similar to the other cities,
                    but starting from a higher baseline. Those declines resulted in Rochester ending 2015 in the middle of
                    this group of cities, with the 11th highest rate out of the 21 cities, with 2755 larcenies per 100,000
                    persons per year. Rochester’s 2016 numbers declined even further, with a rate of 2715. This is the lowest
                    rate and lowest raw number of larcenies in 30 years.
