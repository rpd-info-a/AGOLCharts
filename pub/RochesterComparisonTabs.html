                        <h2>Violent Crime Comparison</h2>
                        This chart shows most cities in our sample clustering between 900 and 1,200 violent crimes per 100,000 persons per year.
                        There are several outliers, with Pontiac, Saginaw and St. Louis having much higher average violent
                        crime rates. Rochester’s average rate for this time period is 999 or 16th out of the 21 total cities.
                        Rochester’s rate has remained fairly stable across the time period, never peaking above 1,260 and
                        remaining consistently below the yearly combined cities’ average. Buffalo, the most similar comparison
                        city, had an average rate of 1,383 across this time period. Rochester’s 2016 rate was 955, eighth
                        out of the twenty-one cities. Rochester was ninth for rape, eleventh for robbery, and sixth for aggravated
                        assault (which, along with murder/manslaughter, are the component crimes of violent crime).

                        <h2>Property Crime Comparison</h2>
                        This chart shows that the overall property crime rate in all cities is decreasing. Every single city had lower property crime
                        rates in 2015 than 1985. In many cases, rates are half those in the 1980s. Rochester’s declines have
                        mirrored the broader national declines, falling from over 10,000 per year to less than 4,000 in 2015.
                        Over the entire time period, Rochester’s property crime rate is 6th out of 21; however property crime
                        has been declining faster in Rochester than in comparable cities. Limiting the look to 2005 – 2015,
                        Rochester ranks 11th out of 21, very close to Buffalo (5,263 & 5,328 respectively). Rochester’s 2016
                        rate was 3,726, continuing the trend of decreasing property crime rates, positioning Rochester in
                        eighth out of the twenty-one cities.

                        <h2>Homicide Comparison</h2>
                        St Louis and Richmond are the clear outliers in this group of cities. 2003 appears to be an abnormally low year for St. Louis,
                        and a small spike for Rochester, resulting in the only year that Rochester had a higher rate than
                        St. Louis. Starting in 2005, Richmond’s rate plummets, and rejoins the cluster of cities that have
                        rates between 10 and 20 homicides per 100,000 persons per year. In contrast to Richmond, Wilmington
                        and Syracuse appear to be trending upwards. The rate of Buffalo, the most similar comparison city,
                        stays close to the rate of Rochester throughout the time period. Rochester’s average homicide rate
                        across the time period was 19.3, or 7th out of the 21 cities. Buffalo’s average is 17.2, and St Louis’s
                        is 43.5. Schenectady, Lansing, and Grand Rapids all had averages under 9. Rochester’s 2016 rate was
                        20.5, very close to Saginaw (20.4), Baton Rouge (20.6) and Syracuse (20.8). Rochester was 12th in
                        2016 out of the 21 cities.

                        This chart shows the majority of cities in the past three years have a rate between 200 and 400 robberies per year. Rochester
                        has been in the middle of that range since 2010, with the exception of a spike in the 2013 rate to
                        436. Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Wilmington have been the cities with the highest rates the past three
                        years, well above 500. Lansing had the lowest rate of these cities every year between 2000 and 2014
                        with rates in the low 200’s until 2015 when several cities experienced severe drops in reported robbery,
                        with Schenectady the lowest at 155. Rochester also experienced a drop in 2015, leading to Rochester’s
                        lowest robbery rate in this time period, 305. Rochester experienced a slight rise in 2016 in robberies,
                        but the overall rate remains low at 320, eleventh out of the twenty-one cities.

                        Rochester’s aggravated assault rate stays consistently below the average rate of these 21 cities. Across the time period,
                        Rochester has the 18th highest assault rate, at 434 per year. Two small cities in Michigan, Saginaw
                        (1,795) and Pontiac (1,513) have the highest rate for this time period, followed by St Louis at 1,445.
                        Rochester’s 2016 numbers keep put it at sixth out of twenty-one, at 463. Akron has the lowest rate
                        for 2016 with 281, while Saginaw has the highest with 1,206.

                        <h2>Burglary Comparison</h2>
                        This chart shows collective burglary rates declining from the 1980s and 1990s to the current time, with a slight uptick in
                        2010 and 2011. Rochester’s rate mirrors this trend. While Rochester’s burglary rate in the 1980s
                        and early 1990s was in the upper half of these cities (7th in 1985 and 1986, 4th in 1989, 2nd in
                        1992, 3rd in 1993), Rochester’s rate declined faster than most comparison cities throughout the 1990s.
                        In 2001 and 2002, Rochester ranked 18th out of the 21 cities. A slight rise in the late 2000s resulted
                        in a peak in 2010, but Rochester has observed consecutive declines every year since then. Rochester’s
                        2016 burglary numbers were the lowest in 30 years, continuing the decrease.

                        <h2>Larceny Comparison</h2>
                        Larceny, like burglary, spiked in the early 1990s and has declined steadily since (without burglary’s spike in the late 2000s).
                        Unlike burglary, Rochester has consistently had higher than average larceny rates, compared with
                        the other twenty cities. Rochester has been experiencing declines in larceny rates similar to the
                        other cities, but starting from a higher baseline. Those declines resulted in Rochester ending 2015
                        in the middle of this group of cities, with the eleventh highest rate out of the twenty-one cities,
                        with a rate of 2,755 larcenies per year. Rochester’s 2016 numbers continued to decline, to 2,706,
                        but Rochester remained in eleventh. This is the lowest rate and lowest raw number of larcenies in
                        Rochester’s previous 30 years.
